# Potential-Lungs-Disease-Detection-Using-Chest-X-RAY

<p>
Potential Lungs Disease Detection is an artificial intelligence-based initiative. For the Model, we employ a deep learning process such as CNN and some advanced variants of CNN, and Python for the back-end. Front end software also uses React and Python.This is a senior year college assignment.

Some of the files are written in the 'ipynb' format because they were created using 'Google colab'. We have included a link to the Google colab notebook in each notebook so that you can download the 'py' format for use.
